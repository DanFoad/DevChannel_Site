# DevChannel_Site
A super secret repo for the DevChannel website

### Test
Requirements:
  1. Python 3
  2. Flask (`pip3 install flask`)

Run `server.py` (`python3 server.py`). After that you can open the site:
  1. If you are on the host computer:  
    `localhost:3000`
  2. If you are on the same network as the host computer:  
    local-ip:3000 (e.g. `192.168.0.100:3000`)
  3. If you are on the other site of the planet:  
    public-ip:3000 (e.g. `60.60.60.60:3000`)
    This one probably requires port-forwarding too!
